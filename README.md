### Building the app yourself

Weatherette is written in Python (Python 3.7), using rumps and appscript
libraries. Additionally you need py2app to build the application package
and create-dmg (awesome little tool for creating dmg files you can find
[here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/create-dmg)).

```
git clone
cd weatherette
python setup.py py2app
```

### FAQ
**Q. But why?**

A. Like with [Beengpaper](https://github.com/rughalt/beengpaper) I got
boread and decided that shelling out cash for for menu-bar application
(that most of the websites featured) is kinda stupid. Of course I didnt
know about
[Weather Bar](https://github.com/manifestinteractive/weather-bar-app)
back then, but well - mine app is simpler.
